3. sum of each pair of binary integers

This problem never state they are signed integers or unsigned integer,
nor stated whether we are allow to use more than 8 bits...
I will treat them as unsigned, and allow more than 8 bits for the result

a, 10101111 + 11011011 = 110001010
b, 10010111 + 11111111 = 110010110
c, 01110101 + 10101100 = 100100001



6. What is the minimum number of binary bits needed to represent each of the following
unsigned decimal integers?
(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536)

a. 4095, minimum 12 bits
b. 65534, minimum 16 bits
c. 42319, minimum 16 bits




8. What is the binary representation of the following hexadecimal numbers?

a, 0126F9D4 => 0000 0001 0010 0110 1111 1001 1101 0100
b, 6ACDFA95 => 0110 1010 1100 1101 1111 1010 1001 0101
c, F69BDC2A => 1111 0110 1001 1011 1101 1100 0010 1010




9. What is the unsigned decimal representation of each of the following hexadecimal integers?

a, 3A => 3*16+10 = 58
b, 1BF => 1*16*16 + 11*16 + 15 = 447
c, 1001 => 1*16*16*16 + 1 = 4097




11. What is the 16-bit hexadecimal representation of each of the following signed decimal integers?
a. -24
We first calculate the positive number 24 signed 16-bits binary representation
24 => 0000 0000 0001 1000
Convert to -24, we got
=> 1111 1111 1110 0111 + 1 => 1111 1111 1110 1000
Now convert binary representation to hexadecimal representation
=> FFE8

b. -331
We first calculate the positive number 331 signed 16-bits binary representation
331 => 0000 0001 0100 1011
Convert to -331, we got
=> 1111 1110 1011 0100 + 1 => 1111 1110 1011 0101
Now convert binary representation to hexadecimal representation
=> FEB5





14. The following 16-bit hexadecimal numbers represent signed integers. Convert each to decimal.

a. 4CD2 => 0100 1100 1101 0010 (this is a positive number)
    => 4*16*16*16+12*16*16+13*16+2 = 19666

b. 8230 => 1000 0010 0011 0000 (this is a negative number)
    => -2^15 + 2^9 + 2^5 + 2^4 = -32208




17. What is the 8-bit binary (twoâ€™s-complement) representation of each of the following signed
decimal integers?
a. -5
We first calculate the positive number 5 8-bis binary representation
5 => 0000 0101
Now convert to -5 binary representation
=> 1111 1010 + 1 
=> 1111 1011

b. -42
We first calculate the positive number 42 8-bits binary representation
42 => 0010 1010
Now convert to -42 binary representation
=> 1101 0101 + 1
=> 1101 0110

c. -16
We first calculate the positive number 16 8-bits binary representation
16 => 0001 0000
Now convert to -16 binary representation
=> 1110 1111 + 1
=> 1111 0000




19. What is the sum of each pair of hexadecimal integers?
a. 6B4 + 3FE = AB2
b. A49 + 6BD = 1106




20. What is the sum of each pair of hexadecimal integers?
a. 7C4 + 3BE = A82
b. B69 + 7AD = 1316
